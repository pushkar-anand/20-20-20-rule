# 20-20-20-rule

This reminds you to look every 20 mins away from your computer screen

>To reduce your risk of tiring your eyes by constantly focusing on your screen, look away from your computer at least every 20 minutes and gaze at a distant object (at least 20 feet away) for at least 20 seconds.  Looking far away relaxes the focusing muscle inside the eye to reduce fatigue.
